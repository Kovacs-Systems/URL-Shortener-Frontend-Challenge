# URL-Shortener-Frontend-Challenge

Your task is to create a React webapp using redux and sagas to shorten URLs. (Sort of like [https://cleanuri.com](http://cleanuri.com))

You can use [https://shrtco.de/docs/?ref=public-apis](https://shrtco.de/docs/?ref=public-apis) to make a request to a url shortener service.

If your api requests fail, you are welcome to use any url shortener api, or even a mock API such as [https://mockapi.io](https://mockapi.io)

Or you can return mock data without actually hitting an API.

Email your finished github project or any questions you may have to brad@ringy.com.
