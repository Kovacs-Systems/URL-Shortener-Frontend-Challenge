# URL-Shortener-Frontend-Challenge

Your task is to create a React webapp using redux and sagas to shorten URLs. (Sort of like [https://cleanuri.com](http://cleanuri.com))

You can use [https://cleanuri.com/docs](https://cleanuri.com/docs) to make a request to a url shortener service.

Due to CORs cleanuri.com api requests may fail. You are welcome to use any url shortener api, or even a mock API such as [https://mockapi.io](https://mockapi.io)
